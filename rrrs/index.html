                <h2>Recycle</h2>
                <p>
                    Recycling in the context of retro consoles means responsibly disposing of unusable parts and 
                    components to prevent them from ending up in landfills. It involves breaking down old electronics and 
                    extracting valuable materials for reuse.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Environmental Protection: Reduces electronic waste, prevents toxic materials from contaminating the soil and water, and lowers the demand for new raw materials.</li>
                    <li>Resource Conservation: Helps in the conservation of precious metals like gold, copper, and platinum, which are commonly found in electronic components.</li>
                    <li>Energy Efficiency: Recycling uses less energy than manufacturing new products from raw materials, thus reducing carbon emissions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="rrr" id="refurbish">
